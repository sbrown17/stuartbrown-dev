    <h1>Justice for JavaScript:</h1>
    <h2>How an unintuitive method for an unintuitive language actually makes sense</h2>

    <p>JavaScript is a notoriously odd language. Maybe in part because it's one of the number one beginner languages, but also because of the fact that it was created in about two weeks and has never looked back since. Everytime someone comes across something odd or some seemingly unintended consequence of JavaScript's design it brings up a "Wat?" moment.</p>
    <p>However, there is one method that gets overlooked or hand waved away as a peculiarity of the language that simply isn't so. I have seen veterans and beginners alike fall pray to this falsity, myself included. I have an old mentor to thank for the clairvoyance I now have on this topic:</p>
    <p>.every()</p>
    <p>This may seem like a simple method, used to match a comparator against elements in an array, a slight misconception of the logical origins of this method will leave a nasty bug that will break in ways that you may never find until it's too late.</p>
