    <h1>StuartBrown.dev</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Stuart Brown, a web developer, nerd/geek, self professed collector of useless knowledge, etc.</p>
    <p>This website will act as a nexus of all things me. From random blog post thoughts to works I feel like sharing. This will probably be under constant, slow construction, but you're welcome anytime.</p>
